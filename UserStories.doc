As a Student,
I want to be able to view comments made by the teacher on homework, test, and Quizzes, 
so that I can better learn from my mistakes.

As a Student,
I want to be confident in my grades not being tampered with, by only the teacher being able add, drop, or change my grades.
So that I can be sure that my grades are true to my performance. 

As a professor,
I want to be able to contact students and be able to see work that they've submitted 
so that there is a clear line of communication between myself and them.

As a professor,
I want all my course materials to be acessible to all my students. So the students can review the course content after class or preview
the course content before the class.

As a professor,
I want my anouncements to be broadcast to all my students,
so the student can receive impotant anouncements like class cancel, homework/grade updates, etc

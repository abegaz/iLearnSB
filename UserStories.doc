so that I can better learn from my mistakes.

I want all my course materials to be acessible to all my students. So the students can review the course content after class or preview
the course content before the class.

As a professor,
I want my anouncements to be broadcast to all my students,
so the student can receive impotant anouncements like class cancel, homework/grade updates, etc 

As a professor,
I want to be able to cross check student submissions and coursework with a database to check for plagiriasm and cheating. It is important
to maintain integrity and honesty.

As a general user, I want to see the software function with reliability and readability using a well-known language such as Java. This gaurentees
a minimal reliability and readability.

functionality to connect whenever and wherever I can.
Good!

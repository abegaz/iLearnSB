As a Student,
I want to be able to view comments made by the teacher on homework, test, and Quizzes, 
so that I can better learn from my mistakes.

As a Student,
I want to be confident in my grades not being tampered with, by only the teacher being able add, drop, or change my grades.
So that I can be sure that my grades are true to my performance. 

As a professor,
I want to be able to contact students and be able to see work that they've submitted 
so that there is a clear line of communication between myself and them.
